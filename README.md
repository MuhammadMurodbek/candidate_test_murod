# Kanban Board

### A modern drag and droppable kanban board that was implemented with new features (CRUD). <br> User can easily work with full-screen calendar, as well as manage upcoming events. In this project I've used json-server as a database regarding to requirements.

# Installation

### You can use a package manage which you like. I've used yarn package manager to build up my application.
